Map of ride starting location popularity

## Summary
It is clear that there are temporal and gender trends in the bikeshare data. You can see from the visualizations that there are popular and unpopular times to rent a citibike and that many more men use the service than women. The temporal trends make sense as the peak riding hours coincide with commuting patterns in general. There could be many reasons for the gender imbalance in the use of the service however. This could be reflective of general bike commuting trends or it could reveal a trend in our relationship with public safety as we travel. A visualization that could be useful would be a map that incorporates gender as a variable in ride count. One other visualization that could be useful would be a map that incorporates both gender and can be filtered by time of day.
